"""
Notes:
    - Given connected graph G with positive edge weights, find a min weight set of edges that 
      connects all of the vertices.
    - A single graph can have multiple spanning trees.
    - MST weight is equal or less than the weights of other spanning trees.
    - MST has V-1 edges

Applications:
    - Networks
    - Approximation algorithms (travelling salesman)
