"""
Notes:
    - Introduced in 1962
    - Algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph with positive and negative weights.
    - No Negative cycles.
    - Uses Dynamic Programming.
    - O(V ^ 3) runtime

Applications:
    - Finding trasitive closure in a directed graph.
    - Inversion of real matrices.
    - Optimal routing.
    - Fast computation of pathfinder networks.
    - Computing similarity b/w graphs.
